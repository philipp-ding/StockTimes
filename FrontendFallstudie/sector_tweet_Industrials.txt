@Bitcoin__Banks Past the 200MA. Until Cathie Wood stops talking about value stocks are still crap and tech is still "undervalued", they're gonna nuke ARKK and all other bloated tech valuations. But it's more scary cause energy, semi's, industrials, financials - nothing is immune.

@jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC weren't you around in 2000 also pumping before the crash?  All bubbles are the same.  Big techs lead, than financials and old industrials, then value stocks.  Crazy bubble behavior like NFT, Crypto, SPAC are all signs of bubbles.  You choose to ignore it and keep pumping.

@jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC weren't you around in 2000 also pumping before the crash?  All bubbles are the same.  Big techs lead, than financials and old industrials, then value stocks.  Crazy bubble behavior like NFT, Crypto, SPAC are all signs of bubbles.  You choose to ignore it and keep pumping.

@Bitcoin__Banks Past the 200MA. Until Cathie Wood stops talking about value stocks are still crap and tech is still "undervalued", they're gonna nuke ARKK and all other bloated tech valuations. But it's more scary cause energy, semi's, industrials, financials - nothing is immune.

@jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC weren't you around in 2000 also pumping before the crash?  All bubbles are the same.  Big techs lead, than financials and old industrials, then value stocks.  Crazy bubble behavior like NFT, Crypto, SPAC are all signs of bubbles.  You choose to ignore it and keep pumping.

@Bitcoin__Banks Past the 200MA. Until Cathie Wood stops talking about value stocks are still crap and tech is still "undervalued", they're gonna nuke ARKK and all other bloated tech valuations. But it's more scary cause energy, semi's, industrials, financials - nothing is immune.

@jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC weren't you around in 2000 also pumping before the crash?  All bubbles are the same.  Big techs lead, than financials and old industrials, then value stocks.  Crazy bubble behavior like NFT, Crypto, SPAC are all signs of bubbles.  You choose to ignore it and keep pumping.

@iramneek I'm running more diversified in names but all very concentrated into just 4 industries (Industrials, Tech Hardware, Software, Consumer). Often i find i usually like multiple stocks in an industry so i buy them all when each individual valuation gets compelling.
@OphirGottlieb what stocks though? growth/tech or energy/financials/industrials?
@JerryCap That's when the stock market was a bunch of industrials and commodity producers.  Not software and consumer goods.

I’m not saying we’re anywhere close to April 2000 (most tech stocks are still up YoY) but _if_ there were something like it today you might want to be in the “tech” companies/startups that sell to other industries, esp. industrials. #deeptech

@iramneek I'm running more diversified in names but all very concentrated into just 4 industries (Industrials, Tech Hardware, Software, Consumer). Often i find i usually like multiple stocks in an industry so i buy them all when each individual valuation gets compelling.
@OphirGottlieb what stocks though? growth/tech or energy/financials/industrials?
@JerryCap That's when the stock market was a bunch of industrials and commodity producers.  Not software and consumer goods.

@JohnHays18 @IngrahamAngle Biden doesn't have anything to do with the stock market. It is the economic attitude of industrials and overall capital segments.
@rafa_prince @WifeyAlpha There’s enough money sloshing around for a melt-up, but if it happens, it will be in select sectors that are now in favor - energy, industrials etc. &amp; maybe a few select stocks powers that be want to save - $AMZN $AAPL $MSFT etc.  Anything can happen now in a manipulated market.

@zhanginu Most brokers anti resources bec can't predict commodity prices &amp; hence have forecasts of falling prices long-term - plus tend to make most money out of trading industrials - so gen don't want to show resource stocks favourably - especially gold stocks.

@ASX_HAMMER_TIME Aussie golds can have 3 issues: 1 Quants in brokers have gold price falling in 2022 &amp; in 2-3 yrs #gold at 1500 to 1650 -so safer to buy industrials; 2 ppl panicking &amp; dumping entire portfolio incl gold stocks; 3 The non-believers exp gold to soon drop - so still shorting heavily.
@zhanginu Most brokers anti resources bec can't predict commodity prices &amp; hence have forecasts of falling prices long-term - plus tend to make most money out of trading industrials - so gen don't want to show resource stocks favourably - especially gold stocks.

@ASX_HAMMER_TIME Aussie golds can have 3 issues: 1 Quants in brokers have gold price falling in 2022 &amp; in 2-3 yrs #gold at 1500 to 1650 -so safer to buy industrials; 2 ppl panicking &amp; dumping entire portfolio incl gold stocks; 3 The non-believers exp gold to soon drop - so still shorting heavily.
@zhanginu Most brokers anti resources bec can't predict commodity prices &amp; hence have forecasts of falling prices long-term - plus tend to make most money out of trading industrials - so gen don't want to show resource stocks favourably - especially gold stocks.

@ASX_HAMMER_TIME Aussie golds can have 3 issues: 1 Quants in brokers have gold price falling in 2022 &amp; in 2-3 yrs #gold at 1500 to 1650 -so safer to buy industrials; 2 ppl panicking &amp; dumping entire portfolio incl gold stocks; 3 The non-believers exp gold to soon drop - so still shorting heavily.
@zhanginu Most brokers anti resources bec can't predict commodity prices &amp; hence have forecasts of falling prices long-term - plus tend to make most money out of trading industrials - so gen don't want to show resource stocks favourably - especially gold stocks.

@zhanginu Most brokers anti resources bec can't predict commodity prices &amp; hence have forecasts of falling prices long-term - plus tend to make most money out of trading industrials - so gen don't want to show resource stocks favourably - especially gold stocks.

@ASX_HAMMER_TIME Aussie golds can have 3 issues: 1 Quants in brokers have gold price falling in 2022 &amp; in 2-3 yrs #gold at 1500 to 1650 -so safer to buy industrials; 2 ppl panicking &amp; dumping entire portfolio incl gold stocks; 3 The non-believers exp gold to soon drop - so still shorting heavily.
@zhanginu Most brokers anti resources bec can't predict commodity prices &amp; hence have forecasts of falling prices long-term - plus tend to make most money out of trading industrials - so gen don't want to show resource stocks favourably - especially gold stocks.
