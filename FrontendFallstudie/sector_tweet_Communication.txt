@wes_white2 Even people with the appropriate amount of stocks and ample communication/education still panic from time to time. 

Maybe the sample size of advisors proactively recommending crypto isn’t big enough, but I find it hard to believe that they don’t get any panicked emails/calls.
More interaction and communication with/from the #Saitama team in 3 months than any token, coin or stock I ever owned. Doesn't mean I get to demand how things are done. I'm a holder. I don't demand answers from Hoskinson when ADA doesn't do anything. Ever. But I still HODL.

@Righteous_Fury_ Correct. And it goes without saying that lines of communication are much shorter for the Ukrainian forces, particularly with the militias/paramilities and (one would hope) pre-positioned stocks.

The second biggest mistake I made in life was not selling my growth stocks three months ago. 

The first biggest mistake was cultivating only analytical skills and not communication skills. Communication skills is a catalyst for analytical skills.

One reason stocks are dropping: The Fed. For 14 years, they have practiced a policy of gradual policy changes and a communication strategy that ensured no surprises. The Fed has abandoned that practice, and that is hitting the most expensive/biggest part of the market (tech).

@Stocktwits ZM video communication it feel make me think about someone. Recently i had strsss with Zoom also. And look , the stock also move exactly same like someone ,
To conclude. Q4 numbers should be strong next week, guidance is a wild card and clear communication is a must. The long-term picture is very bright even assuming no M&amp;A. If the vision ("One stop shop...") materializes the stock should be a star performer for the next 3-5 years.
@ZARA_Care hi there, I’m still waiting for 2 outstanding items to be delivered but I have not received any communication as to when I will get it and an update on a refund for items bought that are now not on stock.
@WalshFreedom They should be allowed to own stock but everything should be managed by a money manager and every communication must be documented.

@Gevo_Inc Ok, fair enough, but what's the hold up on engineering?  What's the progress on financing?  There ought to be some kind of communication on both fronts so investors are not floundering in the dark.  Positive communication based on milestones would add 50% to the stock price IMHO.

@BromptonBicycle Superb but disappointed those who registered who were not one of select few have received no communication at all. Ideally in queue to be offered one in future would be nice. Instead today now found myself registering again - now for an out of stock product.

@ArsenalProfits @GoldQuestCap At this point communication and updates from GQC (or lack thereof) will help dictate stock price until the next filing. With the most recent filing only showing pre-merger financials, we have 2.5-3 months until the first post-merger financials are available.
@UNREALJUST @SamSofiMama @VinGuptaMD @BonaFideMasks Exactly the same here.  But you’d never know they ran out from their public communication.  Publicly they were just swamped and behind getting our orders.  Privately, they ran out of stock.  Supposedly their ethos is transparency, but we sure didn’t see that.

One reason stocks are dropping: The Fed. For 14 years, they have practiced a policy of gradual policy changes and a communication strategy that ensured no surprises. The Fed has abandoned that practice, and that is hitting the most expensive/biggest part of the market (tech).

@Stocktwits ZM video communication it feel make me think about someone. Recently i had strsss with Zoom also. And look , the stock also move exactly same like someone ,
To conclude. Q4 numbers should be strong next week, guidance is a wild card and clear communication is a must. The long-term picture is very bright even assuming no M&amp;A. If the vision ("One stop shop...") materializes the stock should be a star performer for the next 3-5 years.
@ZARA_Care hi there, I’m still waiting for 2 outstanding items to be delivered but I have not received any communication as to when I will get it and an update on a refund for items bought that are now not on stock.
@WalshFreedom They should be allowed to own stock but everything should be managed by a money manager and every communication must be documented.

Midday update: The communication services sector led the decline on the ASX. Financials were soft with the big four banks lower between 0.5% to 1.6%. Firmer commodity prices supported resources stocks with the materials sector up 2.7%.

I hate having to deal with pharmacies. CVS always fucks me over when I need my medication. Your employees suck at communication. Y’all make it impossible for me to consistently be taking my meds because they lack the courtesy of letting you know you don’t have the meds on stock.

@Gevo_Inc Ok, fair enough, but what's the hold up on engineering?  What's the progress on financing?  There ought to be some kind of communication on both fronts so investors are not floundering in the dark.  Positive communication based on milestones would add 50% to the stock price IMHO.

@BromptonBicycle Superb but disappointed those who registered who were not one of select few have received no communication at all. Ideally in queue to be offered one in future would be nice. Instead today now found myself registering again - now for an out of stock product.

@ArsenalProfits @GoldQuestCap At this point communication and updates from GQC (or lack thereof) will help dictate stock price until the next filing. With the most recent filing only showing pre-merger financials, we have 2.5-3 months until the first post-merger financials are available.
@UNREALJUST @SamSofiMama @VinGuptaMD @BonaFideMasks Exactly the same here.  But you’d never know they ran out from their public communication.  Publicly they were just swamped and behind getting our orders.  Privately, they ran out of stock.  Supposedly their ethos is transparency, but we sure didn’t see that.

@NZhuwawo Good evening. They are currently out of stock. Communication will be done once they are in stock. Kindly visit any nearest TelOne shop for application, and you will be wait-listed. We are offering VSAT, ADSL, and FIBRE services, depending on your location. ^LCM #MaskUp
$APTY while i do trust the plan and remain a long term holder. I feel as if the communication could be better. I think as of lately long term holders have dumped the stock due to this.

One reason stocks are dropping: The Fed. For 14 years, they have practiced a policy of gradual policy changes and a communication strategy that ensured no surprises. The Fed has abandoned that practice, and that is hitting the most expensive/biggest part of the market (tech).

Work for an Automotive one. Not sure what car you drove, but do you know who makes the paneling? The steering wheel? They are kept secret on purpose to make it so competition doesn’t get source.

7. No interest, care or focus on the club, only on the fact they have a Hong Kong stock exchange listing whilst they own us.

@Stocktwits ZM video communication it feel make me think about someone. Recently i had strsss with Zoom also. And look , the stock also move exactly same like someone ,
To conclude. Q4 numbers should be strong next week, guidance is a wild card and clear communication is a must. The long-term picture is very bright even assuming no M&amp;A. If the vision ("One stop shop...") materializes the stock should be a star performer for the next 3-5 years.
@ZARA_Care hi there, I’m still waiting for 2 outstanding items to be delivered but I have not received any communication as to when I will get it and an update on a refund for items bought that are now not on stock.
@WalshFreedom They should be allowed to own stock but everything should be managed by a money manager and every communication must be documented.

@JD4for4 Yeah, appreciate your communication and conviction.  
One of the biggest things I did was switch most of my call options over to stock later last year. Glad I did that in retrospect.
@Gevo_Inc Ok, fair enough, but what's the hold up on engineering?  What's the progress on financing?  There ought to be some kind of communication on both fronts so investors are not floundering in the dark.  Positive communication based on milestones would add 50% to the stock price IMHO.

@ArsenalProfits @GoldQuestCap At this point communication and updates from GQC (or lack thereof) will help dictate stock price until the next filing. With the most recent filing only showing pre-merger financials, we have 2.5-3 months until the first post-merger financials are available.
@UNREALJUST @SamSofiMama @VinGuptaMD @BonaFideMasks Exactly the same here.  But you’d never know they ran out from their public communication.  Publicly they were just swamped and behind getting our orders.  Privately, they ran out of stock.  Supposedly their ethos is transparency, but we sure didn’t see that.

@PMArticles Hybrids, improved work performance, got time to plan more, but communication is a bit tough, more meetings. But still better than stock in hours of traffic! Feel more healthy can adjust a bit!
@Rabe9 Nonsensical tweet for a bloke whose stock in trade is communication.

6. Dodgy dealings all over the place means we don't even own the stadium anymore.
7. No interest, care or focus on the club, only on the fact they have a Hong Kong stock exchange listing whilst they own us.

@Stocktwits ZM video communication it feel make me think about someone. Recently i had strsss with Zoom also. And look , the stock also move exactly same like someone ,
To conclude. Q4 numbers should be strong next week, guidance is a wild card and clear communication is a must. The long-term picture is very bright even assuming no M&amp;A. If the vision ("One stop shop...") materializes the stock should be a star performer for the next 3-5 years.
@ZARA_Care hi there, I’m still waiting for 2 outstanding items to be delivered but I have not received any communication as to when I will get it and an update on a refund for items bought that are now not on stock.
@WalshFreedom They should be allowed to own stock but everything should be managed by a money manager and every communication must be documented.

One of the biggest things I did was switch most of my call options over to stock later last year. Glad I did that in retrospect.
@Gevo_Inc Ok, fair enough, but what's the hold up on engineering?  What's the progress on financing?  There ought to be some kind of communication on both fronts so investors are not floundering in the dark.  Positive communication based on milestones would add 50% to the stock price IMHO.

@Raminations Almost everyone in this identifies language solely as a medium for expression, communication. Hence, they see no problem in not being able to read or write. They seldom see a language as a stock of accumulated ideas/knowledge/ thoughts. 1
@Shingeki_No_Eth It is overvalued, like most of NASDAQ IPO'ed tech stock this summer.

Also, the team did a very bad job of communication vesting etc. and a lot of smart contracts where OHM vesting lies are not documented.
Hi @themukulagrawal what should we do for One97 Communication Ltd. any suggestions. Note: This stock has 0(zero) promoter holdings.
@BromptonBicycle Superb but disappointed those who registered who were not one of select few have received no communication at all. Ideally in queue to be offered one in future would be nice. Instead today now found myself registering again - now for an out of stock product.

@ArsenalProfits @GoldQuestCap At this point communication and updates from GQC (or lack thereof) will help dictate stock price until the next filing. With the most recent filing only showing pre-merger financials, we have 2.5-3 months until the first post-merger financials are available.
@UNREALJUST @SamSofiMama @VinGuptaMD @BonaFideMasks Exactly the same here.  But you’d never know they ran out from their public communication.  Publicly they were just swamped and behind getting our orders.  Privately, they ran out of stock.  Supposedly their ethos is transparency, but we sure didn’t see that.
@newsmax Yeah because the lowest unemployment records, Stock market all time highs, housing investments through the roof and so on is so frustrating. Just goes to show you that the hate charged messaging system of the fascist right is way better than the lefts attempt at communication.

@PMArticles Hybrids, improved work performance, got time to plan more, but communication is a bit tough, more meetings. But still better than stock in hours of traffic! Feel more healthy can adjust a bit!
@Rabe9 Nonsensical tweet for a bloke whose stock in trade is communication.

6. Dodgy dealings all over the place means we don't even own the stadium anymore.
7. No interest, care or focus on the club, only on the fact they have a Hong Kong stock exchange listing whilst they own us.
8. No communication whatsoever
@troyewilson You need more shareholder communication. Your stock price is trading 80% cash and 52 week low. Give more company updates what's going on!

@Stocktwits ZM video communication it feel make me think about someone. Recently i had strsss with Zoom also. And look , the stock also move exactly same like someone ,
To conclude. Q4 numbers should be strong next week, guidance is a wild card and clear communication is a must. The long-term picture is very bright even assuming no M&amp;A. If the vision ("One stop shop...") materializes the stock should be a star performer for the next 3-5 years.
@ZARA_Care hi there, I’m still waiting for 2 outstanding items to be delivered but I have not received any communication as to when I will get it and an update on a refund for items bought that are now not on stock.
@WalshFreedom They should be allowed to own stock but everything should be managed by a money manager and every communication must be documented.

One of the biggest things I did was switch most of my call options over to stock later last year. Glad I did that in retrospect.
@Gevo_Inc Ok, fair enough, but what's the hold up on engineering?  What's the progress on financing?  There ought to be some kind of communication on both fronts so investors are not floundering in the dark.  Positive communication based on milestones would add 50% to the stock price IMHO.

@Raminations Almost everyone in this identifies language solely as a medium for expression, communication. Hence, they see no problem in not being able to read or write. They seldom see a language as a stock of accumulated ideas/knowledge/ thoughts. 1
@Shingeki_No_Eth It is overvalued, like most of NASDAQ IPO'ed tech stock this summer.

Also, the team did a very bad job of communication vesting etc. and a lot of smart contracts where OHM vesting lies are not documented.
Hi @themukulagrawal what should we do for One97 Communication Ltd. any suggestions. Note: This stock has 0(zero) promoter holdings.
@BromptonBicycle Superb but disappointed those who registered who were not one of select few have received no communication at all. Ideally in queue to be offered one in future would be nice. Instead today now found myself registering again - now for an out of stock product.
@catboyniki My friend helped me buy it in a group order so they'd have to do it :C and I feel so bad because it's not their fault at ALL! The company just lied about having it in stock and its been months with no communication/still not labeling it as such

@ArsenalProfits @GoldQuestCap At this point communication and updates from GQC (or lack thereof) will help dictate stock price until the next filing. With the most recent filing only showing pre-merger financials, we have 2.5-3 months until the first post-merger financials are available.
@UNREALJUST @SamSofiMama @VinGuptaMD @BonaFideMasks Exactly the same here.  But you’d never know they ran out from their public communication.  Publicly they were just swamped and behind getting our orders.  Privately, they ran out of stock.  Supposedly their ethos is transparency, but we sure didn’t see that.
@newsmax Yeah because the lowest unemployment records, Stock market all time highs, housing investments through the roof and so on is so frustrating. Just goes to show you that the hate charged messaging system of the fascist right is way better than the lefts attempt at communication.

Maybe the sample size of advisors proactively recommending crypto isn’t big enough, but I find it hard to believe that they don’t get any panicked emails/calls.
More interaction and communication with/from the #Saitama team in 3 months than any token, coin or stock I ever owned. Doesn't mean I get to demand how things are done. I'm a holder. I don't demand answers from Hoskinson when ADA doesn't do anything. Ever. But I still HODL.

@BBCSport 5. Nobody truly knows who owns the club.
6. Dodgy dealings all over the place means we don't even own the stadium anymore.
7. No interest, care or focus on the club, only on the fact they have a Hong Kong stock exchange listing whilst they own us.
8. No communication whatsoever
@troyewilson You need more shareholder communication. Your stock price is trading 80% cash and 52 week low. Give more company updates what's going on!

@Stocktwits ZM video communication it feel make me think about someone. Recently i had strsss with Zoom also. And look , the stock also move exactly same like someone ,
To conclude. Q4 numbers should be strong next week, guidance is a wild card and clear communication is a must. The long-term picture is very bright even assuming no M&amp;A. If the vision ("One stop shop...") materializes the stock should be a star performer for the next 3-5 years.
@ZARA_Care hi there, I’m still waiting for 2 outstanding items to be delivered but I have not received any communication as to when I will get it and an update on a refund for items bought that are now not on stock.
@WalshFreedom They should be allowed to own stock but everything should be managed by a money manager and every communication must be documented.

@Gevo_Inc Ok, fair enough, but what's the hold up on engineering?  What's the progress on financing?  There ought to be some kind of communication on both fronts so investors are not floundering in the dark.  Positive communication based on milestones would add 50% to the stock price IMHO.

@Raminations Almost everyone in this identifies language solely as a medium for expression, communication. Hence, they see no problem in not being able to read or write. They seldom see a language as a stock of accumulated ideas/knowledge/ thoughts. 1
@Shingeki_No_Eth It is overvalued, like most of NASDAQ IPO'ed tech stock this summer.

Also, the team did a very bad job of communication vesting etc. and a lot of smart contracts where OHM vesting lies are not documented.
Hi @themukulagrawal what should we do for One97 Communication Ltd. any suggestions. Note: This stock has 0(zero) promoter holdings.
@BromptonBicycle Superb but disappointed those who registered who were not one of select few have received no communication at all. Ideally in queue to be offered one in future would be nice. Instead today now found myself registering again - now for an out of stock product.

Doordash groceries is so hit or miss. Some days I get someone who sends me nice messages asking what I want if something’s out of stock; other times I end up with *six* refunded items and no communication whatsoever 

But I don’t know of any better grocery services :(

@ArsenalProfits @GoldQuestCap At this point communication and updates from GQC (or lack thereof) will help dictate stock price until the next filing. With the most recent filing only showing pre-merger financials, we have 2.5-3 months until the first post-merger financials are available.
@UNREALJUST @SamSofiMama @VinGuptaMD @BonaFideMasks Exactly the same here.  But you’d never know they ran out from their public communication.  Publicly they were just swamped and behind getting our orders.  Privately, they ran out of stock.  Supposedly their ethos is transparency, but we sure didn’t see that.
@newsmax Yeah because the lowest unemployment records, Stock market all time highs, housing investments through the roof and so on is so frustrating. Just goes to show you that the hate charged messaging system of the fascist right is way better than the lefts attempt at communication.

@wes_white2 Even people with the appropriate amount of stocks and ample communication/education still panic from time to time. 

Maybe the sample size of advisors proactively recommending crypto isn’t big enough, but I find it hard to believe that they don’t get any panicked emails/calls.
More interaction and communication with/from the #Saitama team in 3 months than any token, coin or stock I ever owned. Doesn't mean I get to demand how things are done. I'm a holder. I don't demand answers from Hoskinson when ADA doesn't do anything. Ever. But I still HODL.

@BBCSport 5. Nobody truly knows who owns the club.
6. Dodgy dealings all over the place means we don't even own the stadium anymore.
7. No interest, care or focus on the club, only on the fact they have a Hong Kong stock exchange listing whilst they own us.
8. No communication whatsoever
@troyewilson You need more shareholder communication. Your stock price is trading 80% cash and 52 week low. Give more company updates what's going on!

@Stocktwits ZM video communication it feel make me think about someone. Recently i had strsss with Zoom also. And look , the stock also move exactly same like someone ,
To conclude. Q4 numbers should be strong next week, guidance is a wild card and clear communication is a must. The long-term picture is very bright even assuming no M&amp;A. If the vision ("One stop shop...") materializes the stock should be a star performer for the next 3-5 years.
@ZARA_Care hi there, I’m still waiting for 2 outstanding items to be delivered but I have not received any communication as to when I will get it and an update on a refund for items bought that are now not on stock.
@WalshFreedom They should be allowed to own stock but everything should be managed by a money manager and every communication must be documented.

@Gevo_Inc Ok, fair enough, but what's the hold up on engineering?  What's the progress on financing?  There ought to be some kind of communication on both fronts so investors are not floundering in the dark.  Positive communication based on milestones would add 50% to the stock price IMHO.

@Raminations Almost everyone in this identifies language solely as a medium for expression, communication. Hence, they see no problem in not being able to read or write. They seldom see a language as a stock of accumulated ideas/knowledge/ thoughts. 1
@Shingeki_No_Eth It is overvalued, like most of NASDAQ IPO'ed tech stock this summer.

Also, the team did a very bad job of communication vesting etc. and a lot of smart contracts where OHM vesting lies are not documented.

@BromptonBicycle Superb but disappointed those who registered who were not one of select few have received no communication at all. Ideally in queue to be offered one in future would be nice. Instead today now found myself registering again - now for an out of stock product.

@WilliamJB63 @MyBackupBerner @JustinsKicks1 Congrats on getting the console, I wasn't fast enough to see this Saturday, but got off the phone with a rep who confirmed there is contingency stock and corporate told them not to sell any, so it looks like a few lucky ones got the order through before that communication.

@ArsenalProfits @GoldQuestCap At this point communication and updates from GQC (or lack thereof) will help dictate stock price until the next filing. With the most recent filing only showing pre-merger financials, we have 2.5-3 months until the first post-merger financials are available.
@UNREALJUST @SamSofiMama @VinGuptaMD @BonaFideMasks Exactly the same here.  But you’d never know they ran out from their public communication.  Publicly they were just swamped and behind getting our orders.  Privately, they ran out of stock.  Supposedly their ethos is transparency, but we sure didn’t see that.
@newsmax Yeah because the lowest unemployment records, Stock market all time highs, housing investments through the roof and so on is so frustrating. Just goes to show you that the hate charged messaging system of the fascist right is way better than the lefts attempt at communication.

@wes_white2 Even people with the appropriate amount of stocks and ample communication/education still panic from time to time. 

Maybe the sample size of advisors proactively recommending crypto isn’t big enough, but I find it hard to believe that they don’t get any panicked emails/calls.
More interaction and communication with/from the #Saitama team in 3 months than any token, coin or stock I ever owned. Doesn't mean I get to demand how things are done. I'm a holder. I don't demand answers from Hoskinson when ADA doesn't do anything. Ever. But I still HODL.

@Stocktwits ZM video communication it feel make me think about someone. Recently i had strsss with Zoom also. And look , the stock also move exactly same like someone ,
To conclude. Q4 numbers should be strong next week, guidance is a wild card and clear communication is a must. The long-term picture is very bright even assuming no M&amp;A. If the vision ("One stop shop...") materializes the stock should be a star performer for the next 3-5 years.
@ZARA_Care hi there, I’m still waiting for 2 outstanding items to be delivered but I have not received any communication as to when I will get it and an update on a refund for items bought that are now not on stock.
@WalshFreedom They should be allowed to own stock but everything should be managed by a money manager and every communication must be documented.

@Gevo_Inc Ok, fair enough, but what's the hold up on engineering?  What's the progress on financing?  There ought to be some kind of communication on both fronts so investors are not floundering in the dark.  Positive communication based on milestones would add 50% to the stock price IMHO.

@Raminations Almost everyone in this identifies language solely as a medium for expression, communication. Hence, they see no problem in not being able to read or write. They seldom see a language as a stock of accumulated ideas/knowledge/ thoughts. 1
@Shingeki_No_Eth It is overvalued, like most of NASDAQ IPO'ed tech stock this summer.

Also, the team did a very bad job of communication vesting etc. and a lot of smart contracts where OHM vesting lies are not documented.
Hi @themukulagrawal what should we do for One97 Communication Ltd. any suggestions. Note: This stock has 0(zero) promoter holdings.
@BromptonBicycle Superb but disappointed those who registered who were not one of select few have received no communication at all. Ideally in queue to be offered one in future would be nice. Instead today now found myself registering again - now for an out of stock product.
@catboyniki My friend helped me buy it in a group order so they'd have to do it :C and I feel so bad because it's not their fault at ALL! The company just lied about having it in stock and its been months with no communication/still not labeling it as such

@Larry64450205 i remember up to 27 job ads in 2021..  and we could see the results in terms of business.  We should stop stick to any details about this company. The fact is that they have huge stocks, have dispute with main client, and they don't tell anything new. Communication is equal to 0

When it was first invented, it was simply a two-way communication device. 

Then several years later came a few more features: a calculator, some games (only Snake), and a calendar.

Not it is your map, newspaper, weather forecast, stock adviser, health monitor, and much more.

@ArsenalProfits @GoldQuestCap At this point communication and updates from GQC (or lack thereof) will help dictate stock price until the next filing. With the most recent filing only showing pre-merger financials, we have 2.5-3 months until the first post-merger financials are available.
@UNREALJUST @SamSofiMama @VinGuptaMD @BonaFideMasks Exactly the same here.  But you’d never know they ran out from their public communication.  Publicly they were just swamped and behind getting our orders.  Privately, they ran out of stock.  Supposedly their ethos is transparency, but we sure didn’t see that.
@newsmax Yeah because the lowest unemployment records, Stock market all time highs, housing investments through the roof and so on is so frustrating. Just goes to show you that the hate charged messaging system of the fascist right is way better than the lefts attempt at communication.

@wes_white2 Even people with the appropriate amount of stocks and ample communication/education still panic from time to time. 

Maybe the sample size of advisors proactively recommending crypto isn’t big enough, but I find it hard to believe that they don’t get any panicked emails/calls.
More interaction and communication with/from the #Saitama team in 3 months than any token, coin or stock I ever owned. Doesn't mean I get to demand how things are done. I'm a holder. I don't demand answers from Hoskinson when ADA doesn't do anything. Ever. But I still HODL.

But to vote you have to slog down to some location and stand in line? Because Vote By Mail isn't secure?

@BBCSport 5. Nobody truly knows who owns the club.
6. Dodgy dealings all over the place means we don't even own the stadium anymore.
7. No interest, care or focus on the club, only on the fact they have a Hong Kong stock exchange listing whilst they own us.
8. No communication whatsoever
@troyewilson You need more shareholder communication. Your stock price is trading 80% cash and 52 week low. Give more company updates what's going on!

@Stocktwits ZM video communication it feel make me think about someone. Recently i had strsss with Zoom also. And look , the stock also move exactly same like someone ,
To conclude. Q4 numbers should be strong next week, guidance is a wild card and clear communication is a must. The long-term picture is very bright even assuming no M&amp;A. If the vision ("One stop shop...") materializes the stock should be a star performer for the next 3-5 years.
@ZARA_Care hi there, I’m still waiting for 2 outstanding items to be delivered but I have not received any communication as to when I will get it and an update on a refund for items bought that are now not on stock.
@WalshFreedom They should be allowed to own stock but everything should be managed by a money manager and every communication must be documented.

@Gevo_Inc Ok, fair enough, but what's the hold up on engineering?  What's the progress on financing?  There ought to be some kind of communication on both fronts so investors are not floundering in the dark.  Positive communication based on milestones would add 50% to the stock price IMHO.

@Raminations Almost everyone in this identifies language solely as a medium for expression, communication. Hence, they see no problem in not being able to read or write. They seldom see a language as a stock of accumulated ideas/knowledge/ thoughts. 1
@Shingeki_No_Eth It is overvalued, like most of NASDAQ IPO'ed tech stock this summer.

Also, the team did a very bad job of communication vesting etc. and a lot of smart contracts where OHM vesting lies are not documented.

@BromptonBicycle Superb but disappointed those who registered who were not one of select few have received no communication at all. Ideally in queue to be offered one in future would be nice. Instead today now found myself registering again - now for an out of stock product.

@ayeshahazarika Got to say the communication and advisors at No 10 have completely failed dismally. Johnson not bright enough to over rule and they’ve been an embarrassment and laughing stock throughout this debacle. His position is totally untenable so for the sake of the country please go now.
Tennis Australia went beyond its business scope and Craig Tiley abused his power. Lack of internal coordination and communication made Australia a laughing stock in the world, ruined AO reputation. Australia Open is rebranded as Australia Closed. https://t.co/b5tf5pP9JY

@WilliamJB63 @MyBackupBerner @JustinsKicks1 Congrats on getting the console, I wasn't fast enough to see this Saturday, but got off the phone with a rep who confirmed there is contingency stock and corporate told them not to sell any, so it looks like a few lucky ones got the order through before that communication.

See, for the first time in the history of the stock market, retail has won. I'm sure that the SEC knows this, that you know this, the DOJ, and even POTUS. I would think that all of you have had some sort of communication about it.

@wes_white2 Even people with the appropriate amount of stocks and ample communication/education still panic from time to time. 

Maybe the sample size of advisors proactively recommending crypto isn’t big enough, but I find it hard to believe that they don’t get any panicked emails/calls.
More interaction and communication with/from the #Saitama team in 3 months than any token, coin or stock I ever owned. Doesn't mean I get to demand how things are done. I'm a holder. I don't demand answers from Hoskinson when ADA doesn't do anything. Ever. But I still HODL.

@Stocktwits ZM video communication it feel make me think about someone. Recently i had strsss with Zoom also. And look , the stock also move exactly same like someone ,
To conclude. Q4 numbers should be strong next week, guidance is a wild card and clear communication is a must. The long-term picture is very bright even assuming no M&amp;A. If the vision ("One stop shop...") materializes the stock should be a star performer for the next 3-5 years.
@ZARA_Care hi there, I’m still waiting for 2 outstanding items to be delivered but I have not received any communication as to when I will get it and an update on a refund for items bought that are now not on stock.
@WalshFreedom They should be allowed to own stock but everything should be managed by a money manager and every communication must be documented.

@Gevo_Inc Ok, fair enough, but what's the hold up on engineering?  What's the progress on financing?  There ought to be some kind of communication on both fronts so investors are not floundering in the dark.  Positive communication based on milestones would add 50% to the stock price IMHO.

@Raminations Almost everyone in this identifies language solely as a medium for expression, communication. Hence, they see no problem in not being able to read or write. They seldom see a language as a stock of accumulated ideas/knowledge/ thoughts. 1
@Shingeki_No_Eth It is overvalued, like most of NASDAQ IPO'ed tech stock this summer.

Also, the team did a very bad job of communication vesting etc. and a lot of smart contracts where OHM vesting lies are not documented.
Hi @themukulagrawal what should we do for One97 Communication Ltd. any suggestions. Note: This stock has 0(zero) promoter holdings.
@BromptonBicycle Superb but disappointed those who registered who were not one of select few have received no communication at all. Ideally in queue to be offered one in future would be nice. Instead today now found myself registering again - now for an out of stock product.
@catboyniki My friend helped me buy it in a group order so they'd have to do it :C and I feel so bad because it's not their fault at ALL! The company just lied about having it in stock and its been months with no communication/still not labeling it as such

@WilliamJB63 @MyBackupBerner @JustinsKicks1 Congrats on getting the console, I wasn't fast enough to see this Saturday, but got off the phone with a rep who confirmed there is contingency stock and corporate told them not to sell any, so it looks like a few lucky ones got the order through before that communication.
See, for the first time in the history of the stock market, retail has won. I'm sure that the SEC knows this, that you know this, the DOJ, and even POTUS. I would think that all of you have had some sort of communication about it.

@wes_white2 Even people with the appropriate amount of stocks and ample communication/education still panic from time to time. 

Maybe the sample size of advisors proactively recommending crypto isn’t big enough, but I find it hard to believe that they don’t get any panicked emails/calls.
More interaction and communication with/from the #Saitama team in 3 months than any token, coin or stock I ever owned. Doesn't mean I get to demand how things are done. I'm a holder. I don't demand answers from Hoskinson when ADA doesn't do anything. Ever. But I still HODL.

Stock controlling
Closing 31 January 2022
Email CV to: cv@electrodiesel.co.za
@Stocktwits ZM video communication it feel make me think about someone. Recently i had strsss with Zoom also. And look , the stock also move exactly same like someone ,
To conclude. Q4 numbers should be strong next week, guidance is a wild card and clear communication is a must. The long-term picture is very bright even assuming no M&amp;A. If the vision ("One stop shop...") materializes the stock should be a star performer for the next 3-5 years.
@ZARA_Care hi there, I’m still waiting for 2 outstanding items to be delivered but I have not received any communication as to when I will get it and an update on a refund for items bought that are now not on stock.
@WalshFreedom They should be allowed to own stock but everything should be managed by a money manager and every communication must be documented.

@Gevo_Inc Ok, fair enough, but what's the hold up on engineering?  What's the progress on financing?  There ought to be some kind of communication on both fronts so investors are not floundering in the dark.  Positive communication based on milestones would add 50% to the stock price IMHO.

@Raminations Almost everyone in this identifies language solely as a medium for expression, communication. Hence, they see no problem in not being able to read or write. They seldom see a language as a stock of accumulated ideas/knowledge/ thoughts. 1
@Shingeki_No_Eth It is overvalued, like most of NASDAQ IPO'ed tech stock this summer.

Also, the team did a very bad job of communication vesting etc. and a lot of smart contracts where OHM vesting lies are not documented.

@BromptonBicycle Superb but disappointed those who registered who were not one of select few have received no communication at all. Ideally in queue to be offered one in future would be nice. Instead today now found myself registering again - now for an out of stock product.

See, for the first time in the history of the stock market, retail has won. I'm sure that the SEC knows this, that you know this, the DOJ, and even POTUS. I would think that all of you have had some sort of communication about it.

@wes_white2 Even people with the appropriate amount of stocks and ample communication/education still panic from time to time. 

Maybe the sample size of advisors proactively recommending crypto isn’t big enough, but I find it hard to believe that they don’t get any panicked emails/calls.
More interaction and communication with/from the #Saitama team in 3 months than any token, coin or stock I ever owned. Doesn't mean I get to demand how things are done. I'm a holder. I don't demand answers from Hoskinson when ADA doesn't do anything. Ever. But I still HODL.

@Stocktwits ZM video communication it feel make me think about someone. Recently i had strsss with Zoom also. And look , the stock also move exactly same like someone ,
To conclude. Q4 numbers should be strong next week, guidance is a wild card and clear communication is a must. The long-term picture is very bright even assuming no M&amp;A. If the vision ("One stop shop...") materializes the stock should be a star performer for the next 3-5 years.
@ZARA_Care hi there, I’m still waiting for 2 outstanding items to be delivered but I have not received any communication as to when I will get it and an update on a refund for items bought that are now not on stock.
@WalshFreedom They should be allowed to own stock but everything should be managed by a money manager and every communication must be documented.

@Raminations Almost everyone in this identifies language solely as a medium for expression, communication. Hence, they see no problem in not being able to read or write. They seldom see a language as a stock of accumulated ideas/knowledge/ thoughts. 1
@Shingeki_No_Eth It is overvalued, like most of NASDAQ IPO'ed tech stock this summer.

@BromptonBicycle Superb but disappointed those who registered who were not one of select few have received no communication at all. Ideally in queue to be offered one in future would be nice. Instead today now found myself registering again - now for an out of stock product.

@sats360capital The complaints are in the stock manipulation. This thing is so undervalued just based pure on results and communication. It's ridiculous.

One reason stocks are dropping: The Fed. For 14 years, they have practiced a policy of gradual policy changes and a communication strategy that ensured no surprises. The Fed has abandoned that practice, and that is hitting the most expensive/biggest part of the market (tech).

@Stocktwits ZM video communication it feel make me think about someone. Recently i had strsss with Zoom also. And look , the stock also move exactly same like someone ,
To conclude. Q4 numbers should be strong next week, guidance is a wild card and clear communication is a must. The long-term picture is very bright even assuming no M&amp;A. If the vision ("One stop shop...") materializes the stock should be a star performer for the next 3-5 years.
@ZARA_Care hi there, I’m still waiting for 2 outstanding items to be delivered but I have not received any communication as to when I will get it and an update on a refund for items bought that are now not on stock.
@WalshFreedom They should be allowed to own stock but everything should be managed by a money manager and every communication must be documented.

I hate having to deal with pharmacies. CVS always fucks me over when I need my medication. Your employees suck at communication. Y’all make it impossible for me to consistently be taking my meds because they lack the courtesy of letting you know you don’t have the meds on stock.

@Gevo_Inc Ok, fair enough, but what's the hold up on engineering?  What's the progress on financing?  There ought to be some kind of communication on both fronts so investors are not floundering in the dark.  Positive communication based on milestones would add 50% to the stock price IMHO.

Work for an Automotive one. Not sure what car you drove, but do you know who makes the paneling? The steering wheel? They are kept secret on purpose to make it so competition doesn’t get source.

6. Dodgy dealings all over the place means we don't even own the stadium anymore.
7. No interest, care or focus on the club, only on the fact they have a Hong Kong stock exchange listing whilst they own us.
8. No communication whatsoever

@Stocktwits ZM video communication it feel make me think about someone. Recently i had strsss with Zoom also. And look , the stock also move exactly same like someone ,
To conclude. Q4 numbers should be strong next week, guidance is a wild card and clear communication is a must. The long-term picture is very bright even assuming no M&amp;A. If the vision ("One stop shop...") materializes the stock should be a star performer for the next 3-5 years.
@ZARA_Care hi there, I’m still waiting for 2 outstanding items to be delivered but I have not received any communication as to when I will get it and an update on a refund for items bought that are now not on stock.
@WalshFreedom They should be allowed to own stock but everything should be managed by a money manager and every communication must be documented.

One of the biggest things I did was switch most of my call options over to stock later last year. Glad I did that in retrospect.
@Gevo_Inc Ok, fair enough, but what's the hold up on engineering?  What's the progress on financing?  There ought to be some kind of communication on both fronts so investors are not floundering in the dark.  Positive communication based on milestones would add 50% to the stock price IMHO.

@Raminations Almost everyone in this identifies language solely as a medium for expression, communication. Hence, they see no problem in not being able to read or write. They seldom see a language as a stock of accumulated ideas/knowledge/ thoughts. 1
@Shingeki_No_Eth It is overvalued, like most of NASDAQ IPO'ed tech stock this summer.

Also, the team did a very bad job of communication vesting etc. and a lot of smart contracts where OHM vesting lies are not documented.
Hi @themukulagrawal what should we do for One97 Communication Ltd. any suggestions. Note: This stock has 0(zero) promoter holdings.
@BromptonBicycle Superb but disappointed those who registered who were not one of select few have received no communication at all. Ideally in queue to be offered one in future would be nice. Instead today now found myself registering again - now for an out of stock product.

@PMArticles Hybrids, improved work performance, got time to plan more, but communication is a bit tough, more meetings. But still better than stock in hours of traffic! Feel more healthy can adjust a bit!
@Rabe9 Nonsensical tweet for a bloke whose stock in trade is communication.

6. Dodgy dealings all over the place means we don't even own the stadium anymore.
7. No interest, care or focus on the club, only on the fact they have a Hong Kong stock exchange listing whilst they own us.
8. No communication whatsoever
@troyewilson You need more shareholder communication. Your stock price is trading 80% cash and 52 week low. Give more company updates what's going on!

@Stocktwits ZM video communication it feel make me think about someone. Recently i had strsss with Zoom also. And look , the stock also move exactly same like someone ,
To conclude. Q4 numbers should be strong next week, guidance is a wild card and clear communication is a must. The long-term picture is very bright even assuming no M&amp;A. If the vision ("One stop shop...") materializes the stock should be a star performer for the next 3-5 years.
@ZARA_Care hi there, I’m still waiting for 2 outstanding items to be delivered but I have not received any communication as to when I will get it and an update on a refund for items bought that are now not on stock.
@WalshFreedom They should be allowed to own stock but everything should be managed by a money manager and every communication must be documented.

One of the biggest things I did was switch most of my call options over to stock later last year. Glad I did that in retrospect.
@Gevo_Inc Ok, fair enough, but what's the hold up on engineering?  What's the progress on financing?  There ought to be some kind of communication on both fronts so investors are not floundering in the dark.  Positive communication based on milestones would add 50% to the stock price IMHO.

@Raminations Almost everyone in this identifies language solely as a medium for expression, communication. Hence, they see no problem in not being able to read or write. They seldom see a language as a stock of accumulated ideas/knowledge/ thoughts. 1
@Shingeki_No_Eth It is overvalued, like most of NASDAQ IPO'ed tech stock this summer.

Also, the team did a very bad job of communication vesting etc. and a lot of smart contracts where OHM vesting lies are not documented.
Hi @themukulagrawal what should we do for One97 Communication Ltd. any suggestions. Note: This stock has 0(zero) promoter holdings.
@BromptonBicycle Superb but disappointed those who registered who were not one of select few have received no communication at all. Ideally in queue to be offered one in future would be nice. Instead today now found myself registering again - now for an out of stock product.
@catboyniki My friend helped me buy it in a group order so they'd have to do it :C and I feel so bad because it's not their fault at ALL! The company just lied about having it in stock and its been months with no communication/still not labeling it as such

@nosleeprecords Notice how this says nothing about the complete lack of communication on your part. Have some accountability. Also everyone is dealing with delays and stock issues but not month long delays and this was an item that was in-stock so I'm not sure how stock issues play into it.

@jeffkeller1 @buccocapital My 50k ft view:

Communication software stocks are broken right now and therefore difficult. Some of it decel, some increased competition, some of it just bad “1x pull fwd narrative” driven by ZM

TWLO has its own idiosyncratic complexities on top of that 

As I look across…
@stock_guy1 Yes there certainly are people who have lost all faith in media and I think they are making a mistake.  These people think they’ve cracked a code by discovering the media is biased. This is not a newsflash: all communication is biased, and we must read and think critically. 1/

@Life_Disrupted You cannot be serious?
The only one making Truss &amp; the UK a laughing stock is Liz Truss.
Offensive, patronising clothes.
Ignoring the translators.
Ignorant of basic geography &amp; sovereignty.
Trite communication.
Doesn’t listen.
Visit is for self-promotion.

@RealRiddimHours @EndGameWW3 I think they are wrong..military communication has been hardened..civilian infrastructure is highly susceptible.. And you are correct.. Stock up..use credit save cash.if SHTF who's collecting?
@mpirate28 @lena_makes Make contingency plans with family and friends in case communication ceases to exist (walkie-talkies, CB radio, emergency radio). Stock food and water (ramen noodles go a long way). If possible buy a gas generator or a small solar generator with built in battery bank.

@RepJayapal I would rule out owning stocks in a blind trust because it is naive to think there would be no communication between the member of Congress or their representatives and the trust but ETF’s or mutual funds would be acceptable.

@cammccoy @i3energy It has been a very frustrating stock at times, but no fault of the BOD (aside from more communication needed). It’s the lack of positive market sentiment that has made the sp stagnate. But that seems to be changing now with Buy tips from @MerrynSW and @DTquestor #i3e #ite
@PerturbedMole @bt_uk You can also buy them online from places like Amazon. Communication providers have to also provide vulnerable customers one for free under OFCOM'S guidelines.

Yes, some people have the gift of gab, but even for them, it takes (sometimes unconscious) practice to mould their expressions into effective communication. Then they rely on stock manners of speaking for emergencies. Of course it’s not that simple.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian But the execution is important, and this situation would be avoided by communication. What does Trudeau want? Does he want 95% vax rate? Does he want to keep the mandate for 1 more year? Based on what science, and why he arrives at the decision despite the world's opening up
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian So declaring war time emergency against your citizens with no attempt of communication is democracy? They protest against the mandate, not the election. Protests happened throughout history, and the government has every right to clear protests of their street.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian You have to understand Canada's vax rate is 90%+
The truckers want a simple answer: When will Trudeau announce a mandate lift-off ? Trudeau makes no communication with the Conservative party nor the truckers and refuses to give any timeline in the Parliament's debates

Yes, some people have the gift of gab, but even for them, it takes (sometimes unconscious) practice to mould their expressions into effective communication. Then they rely on stock manners of speaking for emergencies. Of course it’s not that simple.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian But the execution is important, and this situation would be avoided by communication. What does Trudeau want? Does he want 95% vax rate? Does he want to keep the mandate for 1 more year? Based on what science, and why he arrives at the decision despite the world's opening up
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian So declaring war time emergency against your citizens with no attempt of communication is democracy? They protest against the mandate, not the election. Protests happened throughout history, and the government has every right to clear protests of their street.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian You have to understand Canada's vax rate is 90%+
The truckers want a simple answer: When will Trudeau announce a mandate lift-off ? Trudeau makes no communication with the Conservative party nor the truckers and refuses to give any timeline in the Parliament's debates

@nosleeprecords Notice how this says nothing about the complete lack of communication on your part. Have some accountability. Also everyone is dealing with delays and stock issues but not month long delays and this was an item that was in-stock so I'm not sure how stock issues play into it.

@cammccoy @i3energy It has been a very frustrating stock at times, but no fault of the BOD (aside from more communication needed). It’s the lack of positive market sentiment that has made the sp stagnate. But that seems to be changing now with Buy tips from @MerrynSW and @DTquestor #i3e #ite

@cammccoy @i3energy It has been a very frustrating stock at times, but no fault of the BOD (aside from more communication needed). It’s the lack of positive market sentiment that has made the sp stagnate. But that seems to be changing now with Buy tips from @MerrynSW and @DTquestor #i3e #ite
@PerturbedMole @bt_uk You can also buy them online from places like Amazon. Communication providers have to also provide vulnerable customers one for free under OFCOM'S guidelines. BT were reserving stock for vulnerable customers so there maybe a delay if trying to buy one from BT Shop. https://t.co/m4GjRoqAuj

Yes, some people have the gift of gab, but even for them, it takes (sometimes unconscious) practice to mould their expressions into effective communication. Then they rely on stock manners of speaking for emergencies. Of course it’s not that simple.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian But the execution is important, and this situation would be avoided by communication. What does Trudeau want? Does he want 95% vax rate? Does he want to keep the mandate for 1 more year? Based on what science, and why he arrives at the decision despite the world's opening up
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian So declaring war time emergency against your citizens with no attempt of communication is democracy? They protest against the mandate, not the election. Protests happened throughout history, and the government has every right to clear protests of their street.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian You have to understand Canada's vax rate is 90%+

@nosleeprecords Notice how this says nothing about the complete lack of communication on your part. Have some accountability. Also everyone is dealing with delays and stock issues but not month long delays and this was an item that was in-stock so I'm not sure how stock issues play into it.

@tokenliberal I replied the biggest thing missing is communication. Easy questions like “where can I buy x?” At the stadium are met with confusion. “When will jerseys be in stock?” Were met with a coy almost cryptic response all season. Upgrading my season tickets was a multi-hour ordeal.
Does it comply with modern wiretapping law? Is the speed of communication equal to that of others? Time in stock trading is money.

@cammccoy @i3energy It has been a very frustrating stock at times, but no fault of the BOD (aside from more communication needed). It’s the lack of positive market sentiment that has made the sp stagnate. But that seems to be changing now with Buy tips from @MerrynSW and @DTquestor #i3e #ite
@PerturbedMole @bt_uk You can also buy them online from places like Amazon. Communication providers have to also provide vulnerable customers one for free under OFCOM'S guidelines.

Yes, some people have the gift of gab, but even for them, it takes (sometimes unconscious) practice to mould their expressions into effective communication. Then they rely on stock manners of speaking for emergencies. Of course it’s not that simple.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian But the execution is important, and this situation would be avoided by communication. What does Trudeau want? Does he want 95% vax rate? Does he want to keep the mandate for 1 more year? Based on what science, and why he arrives at the decision despite the world's opening up
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian So declaring war time emergency against your citizens with no attempt of communication is democracy? They protest against the mandate, not the election. Protests happened throughout history, and the government has every right to clear protests of their street.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian You have to understand Canada's vax rate is 90%+
The truckers want a simple answer: When will Trudeau announce a mandate lift-off ? Trudeau makes no communication with the Conservative party nor the truckers and refuses to give any timeline in the Parliament's debates

@Xchange_stock The sudden shift in management's strategy on the back of slowing user growth combined with poor communication about eBay split makes the recent hammering of the share price completely justified. Having said that, it really does look cheap! #buythedip

@cammccoy @i3energy It has been a very frustrating stock at times, but no fault of the BOD (aside from more communication needed). It’s the lack of positive market sentiment that has made the sp stagnate. But that seems to be changing now with Buy tips from @MerrynSW and @DTquestor #i3e #ite
@PerturbedMole @bt_uk You can also buy them online from places like Amazon. Communication providers have to also provide vulnerable customers one for free under OFCOM'S guidelines. BT were reserving stock for vulnerable customers so there maybe a delay if trying to buy one from BT Shop. https://t.co/m4GjRoqAuj

Yes, some people have the gift of gab, but even for them, it takes (sometimes unconscious) practice to mould their expressions into effective communication. Then they rely on stock manners of speaking for emergencies. Of course it’s not that simple.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian But the execution is important, and this situation would be avoided by communication. What does Trudeau want? Does he want 95% vax rate? Does he want to keep the mandate for 1 more year? Based on what science, and why he arrives at the decision despite the world's opening up
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian So declaring war time emergency against your citizens with no attempt of communication is democracy? They protest against the mandate, not the election. Protests happened throughout history, and the government has every right to clear protests of their street.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian You have to understand Canada's vax rate is 90%+
The truckers want a simple answer: When will Trudeau announce a mandate lift-off ? Trudeau makes no communication with the Conservative party nor the truckers and refuses to give any timeline in the Parliament's debates

@kalinda @kadiebug12 @BonaFideMasks Exactly this.  They continued taking orders for masks they no longer had in stock well after they ran out - while continuing to list these masks as in stock on their site.  They been less than truthful in their public communication about it, too.

@nosleeprecords Notice how this says nothing about the complete lack of communication on your part. Have some accountability. Also everyone is dealing with delays and stock issues but not month long delays and this was an item that was in-stock so I'm not sure how stock issues play into it.

@tokenliberal I replied the biggest thing missing is communication. Easy questions like “where can I buy x?” At the stadium are met with confusion. “When will jerseys be in stock?” Were met with a coy almost cryptic response all season. Upgrading my season tickets was a multi-hour ordeal.
Does it comply with modern wiretapping law? Is the speed of communication equal to that of others? Time in stock trading is money.

@cammccoy @i3energy It has been a very frustrating stock at times, but no fault of the BOD (aside from more communication needed). It’s the lack of positive market sentiment that has made the sp stagnate. But that seems to be changing now with Buy tips from @MerrynSW and @DTquestor #i3e #ite
@PerturbedMole @bt_uk You can also buy them online from places like Amazon. Communication providers have to also provide vulnerable customers one for free under OFCOM'S guidelines.

@ACInvestorBlog YES $MULN  I think there is a bit of a problem with communication of the stock and maybe the recent financing. But very unique approach to EVs. From the wheels to the battery to the tech.  Great company
I’m not sure if the guard actually shows a green flag though—might be for older stock without electronic communication with the driver.

Yes, some people have the gift of gab, but even for them, it takes (sometimes unconscious) practice to mould their expressions into effective communication. Then they rely on stock manners of speaking for emergencies. Of course it’s not that simple.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian But the execution is important, and this situation would be avoided by communication. What does Trudeau want? Does he want 95% vax rate? Does he want to keep the mandate for 1 more year? Based on what science, and why he arrives at the decision despite the world's opening up
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian So declaring war time emergency against your citizens with no attempt of communication is democracy? They protest against the mandate, not the election. Protests happened throughout history, and the government has every right to clear protests of their street.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian You have to understand Canada's vax rate is 90%+
The truckers want a simple answer: When will Trudeau announce a mandate lift-off ? Trudeau makes no communication with the Conservative party nor the truckers and refuses to give any timeline in the Parliament's debates

@Xchange_stock The sudden shift in management's strategy on the back of slowing user growth combined with poor communication about eBay split makes the recent hammering of the share price completely justified. Having said that, it really does look cheap! #buythedip

@cammccoy @i3energy It has been a very frustrating stock at times, but no fault of the BOD (aside from more communication needed). It’s the lack of positive market sentiment that has made the sp stagnate. But that seems to be changing now with Buy tips from @MerrynSW and @DTquestor #i3e #ite
@PerturbedMole @bt_uk You can also buy them online from places like Amazon. Communication providers have to also provide vulnerable customers one for free under OFCOM'S guidelines. BT were reserving stock for vulnerable customers so there maybe a delay if trying to buy one from BT Shop. https://t.co/m4GjRoqAuj

Yes, some people have the gift of gab, but even for them, it takes (sometimes unconscious) practice to mould their expressions into effective communication. Then they rely on stock manners of speaking for emergencies. Of course it’s not that simple.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian But the execution is important, and this situation would be avoided by communication. What does Trudeau want? Does he want 95% vax rate? Does he want to keep the mandate for 1 more year? Based on what science, and why he arrives at the decision despite the world's opening up
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian So declaring war time emergency against your citizens with no attempt of communication is democracy? They protest against the mandate, not the election. Protests happened throughout history, and the government has every right to clear protests of their street.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian You have to understand Canada's vax rate is 90%+
The truckers want a simple answer: When will Trudeau announce a mandate lift-off ? Trudeau makes no communication with the Conservative party nor the truckers and refuses to give any timeline in the Parliament's debates

@kalinda @kadiebug12 @BonaFideMasks Exactly this.  They continued taking orders for masks they no longer had in stock well after they ran out - while continuing to list these masks as in stock on their site.  They been less than truthful in their public communication about it, too.

@nosleeprecords Notice how this says nothing about the complete lack of communication on your part. Have some accountability. Also everyone is dealing with delays and stock issues but not month long delays and this was an item that was in-stock so I'm not sure how stock issues play into it.

Does it comply with modern wiretapping law? Is the speed of communication equal to that of others? Time in stock trading is money.

@cammccoy @i3energy It has been a very frustrating stock at times, but no fault of the BOD (aside from more communication needed). It’s the lack of positive market sentiment that has made the sp stagnate. But that seems to be changing now with Buy tips from @MerrynSW and @DTquestor #i3e #ite
@PerturbedMole @bt_uk You can also buy them online from places like Amazon. Communication providers have to also provide vulnerable customers one for free under OFCOM'S guidelines.

US stocks tumbled Thursday on heightened Russia-Ukraine tensions as Biden said the invasion could occur in the next few days. Nasdaq -2.88% and S&amp;P 500 -2.12%, with tech and communication services among the biggest losers.
@ACInvestorBlog YES $MULN  I think there is a bit of a problem with communication of the stock and maybe the recent financing. But very unique approach to EVs. From the wheels to the battery to the tech.  Great company
I’m not sure if the guard actually shows a green flag though—might be for older stock without electronic communication with the driver.

Yes, some people have the gift of gab, but even for them, it takes (sometimes unconscious) practice to mould their expressions into effective communication. Then they rely on stock manners of speaking for emergencies. Of course it’s not that simple.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian But the execution is important, and this situation would be avoided by communication. What does Trudeau want? Does he want 95% vax rate? Does he want to keep the mandate for 1 more year? Based on what science, and why he arrives at the decision despite the world's opening up
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian So declaring war time emergency against your citizens with no attempt of communication is democracy? They protest against the mandate, not the election. Protests happened throughout history, and the government has every right to clear protests of their street.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian You have to understand Canada's vax rate is 90%+
The truckers want a simple answer: When will Trudeau announce a mandate lift-off ? Trudeau makes no communication with the Conservative party nor the truckers and refuses to give any timeline in the Parliament's debates

@SeanOhhhh I say no DM'S. But, I do communicate with a couple people. I've known one of them since 5th grade. That's approximately 50 years ago. I want to be able to have that communication. I just don't want strangers contacting me, especially about crypto or stock market trading.
@DJMoonNFT @MysticMessEdits @NFTMintQueen @NFTCryptoChicks They aren’t in communication, @NFTCryptoChicks is saying it’s from a stock website. Which even then is a lie as the stock ones dont have the same coloration which was lifted for OG CC #2z

@Xchange_stock The sudden shift in management's strategy on the back of slowing user growth combined with poor communication about eBay split makes the recent hammering of the share price completely justified. Having said that, it really does look cheap! #buythedip

@cammccoy @i3energy It has been a very frustrating stock at times, but no fault of the BOD (aside from more communication needed). It’s the lack of positive market sentiment that has made the sp stagnate. But that seems to be changing now with Buy tips from @MerrynSW and @DTquestor #i3e #ite
@PerturbedMole @bt_uk You can also buy them online from places like Amazon. Communication providers have to also provide vulnerable customers one for free under OFCOM'S guidelines. BT were reserving stock for vulnerable customers so there maybe a delay if trying to buy one from BT Shop. https://t.co/m4GjRoqAuj

Yes, some people have the gift of gab, but even for them, it takes (sometimes unconscious) practice to mould their expressions into effective communication. Then they rely on stock manners of speaking for emergencies. Of course it’s not that simple.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian But the execution is important, and this situation would be avoided by communication. What does Trudeau want? Does he want 95% vax rate? Does he want to keep the mandate for 1 more year? Based on what science, and why he arrives at the decision despite the world's opening up
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian So declaring war time emergency against your citizens with no attempt of communication is democracy? They protest against the mandate, not the election. Protests happened throughout history, and the government has every right to clear protests of their street.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian You have to understand Canada's vax rate is 90%+

@cammccoy @i3energy It has been a very frustrating stock at times, but no fault of the BOD (aside from more communication needed). It’s the lack of positive market sentiment that has made the sp stagnate. But that seems to be changing now with Buy tips from @MerrynSW and @DTquestor #i3e #ite
@PerturbedMole @bt_uk You can also buy them online from places like Amazon. Communication providers have to also provide vulnerable customers one for free under OFCOM'S guidelines.

@ACInvestorBlog YES $MULN  I think there is a bit of a problem with communication of the stock and maybe the recent financing. But very unique approach to EVs. From the wheels to the battery to the tech.  Great company

Yes, some people have the gift of gab, but even for them, it takes (sometimes unconscious) practice to mould their expressions into effective communication. Then they rely on stock manners of speaking for emergencies. Of course it’s not that simple.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian But the execution is important, and this situation would be avoided by communication. What does Trudeau want? Does he want 95% vax rate? Does he want to keep the mandate for 1 more year? Based on what science, and why he arrives at the decision despite the world's opening up
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian So declaring war time emergency against your citizens with no attempt of communication is democracy? They protest against the mandate, not the election. Protests happened throughout history, and the government has every right to clear protests of their street.
@stock_driver_ @fundstrat @jonnajarian You have to understand Canada's vax rate is 90%+
The truckers want a simple answer: When will Trudeau announce a mandate lift-off ? Trudeau makes no communication with the Conservative party nor the truckers and refuses to give any timeline in the Parliament's debates

@Biohazard3737 $QURE has poor communication.  They had AMT-180 (GT- hem A) and dropped it without explanation.  Also misread the market with CSL agreement that sucked the life out of the stock.
